      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is a software tool that runs applications using containers. Containers are used in order to ensure that application codes are all standardized and thus can be used on any Linux machine even if there are certain settings that are different. Furthermore, Dockers are important as instead of creating a whole virtual host system, they merely provide the necessary applications that are unavailable on the host Linux system. Lastly, Docker is cuztomizable for developers who need to utilize applications that arent available on the standard application containers.

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>A virtual machine is an emulation of a physical computer - the end result is the user being able to receive the same experience on a window of the physical computer as the host operating system. Virtual machines do not affect the processes of the physical operating system and have their own CPU's, netwrks and interfaces. Running VM's is beneficial for testing and employing applications that may not be easily run on the host system. Companies may use VM's due to having a multitude of apps that need to be tested and do not want to spend on physical computers and maintenance/depreciation.
