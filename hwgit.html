      <h2>What is Git? Why do we need Source Code Control System</h2>
      <p> Git is a free software tracking system that is used by developers and teams to track changes in codes. Git is used mainly by teams simultaneoulsy working on coordinating codes and files. Version control is important as codes and files that undergo various revisions and receive various inputs from different users might need to be tracked due to the ease of people being able to change the code. Source code control is also helpful when one needs to find out the version of code that is currently being used amongst the multiple versions. or merge different version of the same code for optimal efficiency.

      <h2>b.  Describe following terms: 1) local repo 2) remote repo 3) how to use GIT in Team Project â€“ multiple developers work on the same project at the same time </h2>
      <p> Local Repo - Local repositories are for the direct use of the user and usually stored in the computer of the user. The work one does on code is stored in the local repo and all changes and modifications are made in the local folder only. 
      Remote Repo - A remote repository on the other hand is used for users and teams and modifications to the code are always made in the local repo then pushed to the remote repo for the other users. 
      In order to use GIT for team projects, a user must first create a local branch as the master branch should not be updated individually by team members. Once the local branch has been created, any changes and additions can be made to the local branch and pushed onto the github branch. This is done by pulling snapshots of code from the master onto the local, which once finished is merged back with the master. Once a local branch is merged with the master (changes from local branch are pushed to a branch in repo in Github), a pull request should be sent so that parties can review, change and push commits to the code.
