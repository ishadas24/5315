      <h2>What is Git? Why do we need Source Code Control Systemoki</h2>
      <p> Git is a free software tracking system that is used by developers and teams to track changes in codes. Git is used mainly by teams simultaneoulsy working on coordinating codes and files. Version control is important. Version control is important as codes and files that undergo various revisions and receive various inputs from different users might need to be tracked due to the ease of people being able to change the code. Source code control is also helpful when one needs to find out the version of code that is currently being used amongst the multiple versions. or merge different version of the same code for optimal efficiency.

      <h2>b.  Describe following terms: 1) local repo 2) remote repo 3) how to use GIT in Team Project â€“ multiple developers work on the same project at the same time </h2>
      <p> Local Repo - Local repositories are for the direct use of the user and usually stored in the computer of the user. The work one does on code is stored in the local repo and all changes and modifications are made in the local folder only. 
      Remote Repo - A remote repository on the other hand is used for users and teams and modifications to the code are always made in the local repo then pushed to the remote repo for the other users.
